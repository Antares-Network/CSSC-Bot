# CSSC-bot Contributing guidelines

## Developing New Features

First create a new branch with it's base set to the [staging](https://github.com/Antares-Network/CSSC-Bot/tree/staging) branch.  
For naming conventions use `feature/GithubUsername/FeatureName`. Example: `feature/nathen418/mongodb-support`  
Next when your feature is ready to be merged, submit a pull request to the [staging](https://github.com/Antares-Network/CSSC-Bot/tree/staging) branch.  
This will be used to test your changes along side the rest of the code and any other pending new features.

## Fixing Bugs

Do the same as the instructions except when naming your branch use the naming convention: `bugfix/GithubUsername/BugName`. Example: `bugfix/nathen418/fix-api-connection-err`  

## Editing/Merging Pull Requests

Only merge pull requests you authored or have been approved by the author to merge.  

## Pushing to branches

Only push to branches you have been given permission to push to. This means that you should only commit to branches that have your name in the branch name unless the branch owner has given you permission to push to it.
